# Scripts

Some useful scripts Crescendo will use for running tests and installing the package.

-   `install.sh`: install utility
-   `run_examples.sh`: runs all of the examples contained in the `examples` directory
-   `smoke.sh`: runs smoke tests for a quick evaluation of how the code all works together
