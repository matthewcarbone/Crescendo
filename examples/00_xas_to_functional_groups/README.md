# XANES-functional group prediction

<div align="center">

⚠️ **This directory contains only examples. The data stored here does not constintute the complete databases used in published work!**

Here, we show examples of attempting to predict whether or not functional groups are present on molecules, using only their X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra.
