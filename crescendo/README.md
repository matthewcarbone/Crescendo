# Crescendo core module
The complete machine learning pipeline requires the following components.
* `datasets` - methods for ingesting and processing data into different representations.
* `samplers` - different ways to sample data. The simplest and by far most commonly used sampler is a simple random sampler.
* `models` - a variety of different machine learning model architectures.
* `protocols` - training and evaluation methods.
* `utils` - common utilities that all modules above may use.
