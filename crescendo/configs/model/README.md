# Models

A zoo of useful models!

-   `mlp_default.yaml`: All default parameters used by the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models.
-   `mlp.yaml`: The usual MLP with specs for regression: input vector to output vector.
-   `mlp_random_architecture.yaml`: A special type of MLP which uses the global seed to randomly initialize the neural network architecture.
