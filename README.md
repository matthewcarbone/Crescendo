Crescendo provides a unified command line + API for training and evaluating Lightning models

------------

‚ö†Ô∏è **Crescendo is a work in progress and highly subject to change**

üôè Some of our boilerplate is based on the wonderful template by [ashleve](https://github.com/ashleve)! See here: [github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).

# Summary

‚≠êÔ∏è Crescendo leverages the power of [Hydra](https://hydra.cc), [Lightning](https://lightning.ai) and the humble command line to make executing the training of neural networks as easy as possible.

‚≠êÔ∏è Hydra supports an incredible suite of tools such as powerful approaches for hyperparameter tuning. These are built in and accessible.

‚≠êÔ∏è Loading your models will be handled with the `crescendo.analysis` API, so you can train your models via the command line on a supercomputer, then load the results in your local Jupyter notebook.

# Install

At the moment, the recommended way to use this work is to install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matthewcarbone/Crescendo.git
cd Crescendo
conda create -n py3.9-crescendo python=3.9 -y
conda activate py3.9-crescendo
pip install --editable .
```

This installs the `cr` command line executable which can be run anywhere on your computer, but still references the `crescendo/configs` files, which you can customize to your liking. A simple example to test that everything is working properly:

```bash
cr model=mlp data=california_housing
```
