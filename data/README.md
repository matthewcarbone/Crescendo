# Data
A small repository of in-house stored data used mainly for testing purposes.

## Test csv data
`test_10_column.csv`, `test_3_column.csv`: randomly generated csv files used for testing the csv loaders.

## Test QM9 data

A subet of the QM9 database, found here: [here](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/), is stored in `qm9_test_data`. Only 10 molecules are stored in this repository solely for testing. Please see the original download location for the full dataset, and be sure to cite the appropriate work.
